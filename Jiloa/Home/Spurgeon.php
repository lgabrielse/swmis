Now by using just one line of code, you can put this devotional by the Prince of Preachers on your web page.

       The devotional for the current date will automatically update, and is different each Morning and Evening.

       Keep your visitors coming back to your site day after day to get their twice-daily filling of these great and inspirational writings.

       The current devotional is shown in the table to the right, set at a width of 300 pixels, but you can change that to anything you need.

       Just copy the code from the box below and paste it into your web page where you want the table to go.

       Simple Changes: You can remove the Bible Search simply by changing search=1 to search=0.

       By default the time is set to GMT. Set your time zone by adding + or - e.g. for New York, change zone=0 to zone=-5. Don't forget the plus or minus sign. If you are unsure of the offset from GMT for your time zone, click here to see a world map that will help.

       The only other thing you may want to change is the section that reads width=300. Set the 300 to anything you need, or if you set it to 0 then the table will automatically be the width of the browser window or of the enclosing table. You can also use a percentage(%) if you want, e.g. width=75%.

       The minimum width of the table is 120 pixels, and I would suggest a maximum of 600 pixels so that it will fit in any browser window. (Many people still have a maximum screen width of 640 pixels.) Take the code and try it out. Don't worry you can't break it!
